In moles (Talpidae) in general and in the star-nosed mole (<italic>Condylura cristata</italic>) in particular, the rhinarium has exquisite tactile sensitivity, mediated by a special sensory structure in the skin, Eimer&#x02019;s organ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In the raccoon (<italic>Procyon lotor</italic>) and the coati (<italic>Nasua nasua</italic>), two carnivoran species with well-developed rhinaria without Eimer&#x02019;s organs, activity was elicited in the trigeminal ganglion by stimulation of the rhinarium skin with various non-chemical stimulus modalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The authors concluded that the rhinaria of the studied species seem to have a primary function other than gathering tactile information. Curiously, the temperature of the carnivoran rhinarium in awake animals is considerably lower than in other mammalian groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In alert dogs (<italic>Canis familiaris</italic>), the temperature of the rhinarium follows a characteristic pattern. At 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, it is about 5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C colder than ambient temperature, about equal at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and about 8&#x02009;&#x000b0;C at 0&#x02009;&#x000b0;C ambient temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Rich innervation by the trigeminus nerve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>a</sup> suggests a sensory function.</p><p id="Par3">A role of the wet rhinarium in thermoregulation is unlikely, because its surface area is too small in relation to body size. Furthermore, if a dog is exposed to moderate heat stress and starts to pant, it extends the tongue from the open mouth (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The tongue is wet and warm, despite the airflow generated by panting, and is thus effectively dissipating surplus body heat by radiation and evaporation. The rhinarium, however, remains cold (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and is therefore ineffective.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Thermograph of a dog in the shade at 27&#x02009;&#x000b0;C ambient temperature.

The ability to sense such radiation is known in insects (Black fire beetle, <italic>Melanophila acuminata</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, reptiles (certain snake species: Crotalinae, Boidae)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and one species of mammal so far, the common vampire bat, <italic>Desmodus rotundus</italic>), which can detect skin areas richly perfused with blood and thus suitable for biting after landing on a host animal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">The rhinarium is the prime candidate as the sensory structure in dogs. Thermal photons are too weak to isomerize a photopigment in the eye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the water in the aqueous and vitreous bodies of the eye effectively absorbs thermal radiation. Except for the rhinarium, all other parts of a dog&#x02019;s face are covered by insulating fur. The sensitive area in vampire bats is also in the nasal region and it is also somewhat colder than other parts of the face<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">The cortical area showing significant activation in response to the <italic>warm</italic> condition is located at the caudal border of the left parietal somatosensory cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref><italic>b</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This area seems to play a crucial role in co-registering different sensory information (e.g. visual, somatosensory, proprioception) in order to plan and guide specific, goal-directed actions (e.g. targeting)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This may suggest that the heat signal has been perceived as part of a complex environmental stimulus, eliciting the &#x02018;neural planning&#x02019; of oriented, goal-directed actions. Assuming that a heat sense plays a role in predatory behaviour, this may also indicate a rapid integration of multisensory input and the subsequent motor output. Although the region of the cortical representation of the tip of the nose is only a few millimeters in size, given the location of the significant neural activation at the end of the rostral suprasylvian groove<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and the fact that the experiment was carefully controlled to preclude the activation of other sensory systems, we can state that the cortical region showing significant activation is most probably representing the nasal region. Also,&#x000a0;the location of the detected activation is clearly distinguishable from the auditory and olfactory cortical areas. According to anatomical textbooks &#x02013; based on lesion studies &#x02013; the primary cortical olfactory area is the piriform lobe, as well as the lateral olfactory gyrus and the parahippocampal gyrus. Olfactory fibres originating from the olfactory bulb reach this area via the lateral olfactory tract, bypassing the thalamus along the way<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. An fMRI study investigating the dog&#x02019;s olfactory system in conscious and anesthetized animals found activation in the olfactory bulb and bilateral piriform lobes, including anterior olfactory cortex, piriform cortex, periamygdala, and entorhinal cortex for both low and high odour concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, while another found activation in the olfactory bulb, periamygdala, entorhinal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The primary auditory area of the dog lies largely in the temporal lobe, centred around the middle ectosylvian gyrus involving the caudal ectosylvian and sylvian gyri as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref><italic>b</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The dorsal and rostral regions of the sylvian gyrus are part of the auditory association cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref><italic>b</italic></sup>. In two fMRI studies where the auditory regions were localized functionally, the following areas were found to be activated: (1) Sylvian gyri along the pseudosylvian fissure (extending ventrally toward the temporal pole) and the ectosylvian gyri along the ectosylvian sulcus extending dorsally to the suprasylvian sulcus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>; (2) right middle suprasylvian sulcus; left middle ectosylvian sulcus; right caudal ectosylvian gyrus; left middle ectosylvian gyrus; right tectum mesencephali; left tectum mesencephali<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The above mentioned studies and anatomical data point to the fact that the heat stimulus was not detected by either the olfactory or auditory systems. Our finding of the left hemispheric bias of the cortical activation complements and lends further support to this assumption. In most studied vertebrates, feeding responses such as food discrimination or striking at prey were predominantly processed by the left hemisphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, for broader reviews see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In dogs specifically, it has been found that in a detour-task, attack-trained dogs that showed a preference using their right visual hemifield (mainly processed by the left hemisphere) needed less time to solve the task than those that preferably used their left visual hemifield, in line with the specialization of the left hemisphere in prey-catching behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">Our hemispheric asymmetry findings also seem to be in agreement with the Valence Model of cerebral emotional processing, since according to this hypothesis, positive emotions or approach-related emotional states &#x02013; congruent with food-related neural responses &#x02013; are processed predominantly in the left hemisphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Corresponding to this hemispherical lateralization, asymmetrical behaviours have been found in dogs in response to different types of emotional stimuli. For instance, dogs have been found to use their left nostril more often to sniff human odours collected during fearful situations and physical stress, suggesting a left hemisphere bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. An interesting hypothesis regarding this lateralized behaviour is that these fearful heterospecific chemosignals elicit dogs&#x02019; prey drive reflected in left-lateralized neural activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

(2007) have found that dogs preferentially wagged their tail to the right (contralateral, left hemisphere control) when presented with positive stimuli (i.e. the dog&#x02019;s owner), while the opposite direction was preferred with emotionally negative stimuli (i.e. a dominant dog)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Similar results have been found in the study of&#x000a0;Racca <italic>et al</italic>.

In the training, we exclusively used positive reinforcement, rewarding the dogs with food (Frolic, Mars Inc., McLean, USA) and praise. All animals were healthy and remained healthy for the duration of the experiments.

Ambient temperature (18.8&#x02013;19.3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) was monitored with a digital thermometer (EN 13485, TFA Dostmann, Wertheim, Germany). The temperature of the dog&#x02019;s rhinarium was measured with a thermographic camera (FLIR E30) before, during, and after each session. Biological tissue has high thermal emissivity (approx. 0.98, e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and ambient temperature was close to the skin&#x02019;s temperature, such that reflected temperature was of minor importance. The emissivity setting of the camera was therefore kept at 1.0 because the possible error was minimal (max. 0.1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) and with this setting, the camera could also be used for measuring and checking the radiating temperature of the stimulus.</p><p id="Par25">The room contained an experimental arena delimited on the long sides by sheets of dark plywood and on one short side by a wooden frame with a roller blind. A 15&#x02009;W fan (Faset, Rusta, Upplands V&#x000e4;sby, Sweden) was blowing from the top of the frame 45&#x000b0; downward and towards the other short side of the arena where the stimuli were presented. While the dog was waiting outside the arena for the next trial, the blind was closed, preventing the dog from entering the arena and seeing how the next trial was set up (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). A plywood divider, 1.6&#x02009;m&#x02009;in length measured from the stimulus surfaces, separated the left and right stimuli. There was another 0.4&#x02009;m between the end of the divider and the blind. The materials used in the set-up were of the same types and ages on both sides.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Thermal stimuli</title><p id="Par26">The stimuli were generated with two 42&#x02009;mm thick panels, 300 &#x000d7;320&#x02009;mm&#x02009;in surface area (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). One face of each panel consisted of a 6&#x02009;mm aluminum plate, carrying a heating wire driven by a low-voltage DC on the inside of the panel. The aluminum plate was connected with the other side, consisting of 12&#x02009;mm plywood, by a hardwood frame equipped with a wooden handle. The frame was filled with 24&#x02009;mm of expanded polystyrene foam to insulate the cold surface from the warm one. Both outer surfaces (aluminum and plywood) were covered with matt black adhesive plastic foil of high thermal emissivity (d-c-fix, Konrad Hornschuch, Weissbach, Germany). The driving voltage was adjusted such that the radiating temperature of the <italic>warm</italic> surface was about 11&#x02013;13&#x02009;&#x000b0;C above ambient temperature (31&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) to approximately match the stimulus to sources of thermal radiation relevant for a predator e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Despite insulation, some heat leaked over to the cold surface (the <italic>neutral</italic> stimulus), which was 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C warmer than ambient temperature. The voltage was turned on for both panels at least 30&#x02009;min before a session in order to reach operating temperature and stayed on during the session to avoid acoustic cues caused by thermal movements. The fan was turned on and stayed on simultaneously.</p><p id="Par27">The panels were positioned on sliding drawer mounts and held by magnets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Each panel could be turned around by 180 degrees on its slider to present the <italic>warm</italic> surface on one side of the presenting apparatus and on the other side the <italic>neutral</italic> surface to the dog (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), which means that there was always a <italic>warm</italic> and a <italic>neutral</italic> panel surface on both sides of the presenting apparatus. The panels were lifted off and put back on the sliders every time, even if they were not turned around, to avoid giving the waiting dog any acoustic or timing cues. Under both panels, shielded from any thermal radiation, there were bowls containing the same amount and type of food. Measurements with a thermal camera confirmed that the food remained at ambient temperature even during prolonged operation. On the <italic>neutral</italic> stimulus side, the sliding mechanism was blocked, invisibly to the dog, so that the food reward was inaccessible. On the <italic>warm</italic> stimulus side, the dog could push the slider backwards to access the food, during initial training touching the surface with its rhinarium so that the warm stimulus and the food reward were intuitively connected. Inequalities between the sides were avoided as much as possible by using materials of the same type and age, the same type and amount of food, the same, closed positions of the sliders, and the fan blowing from the dog&#x02019;s position towards the presenting apparatus. This was intended to make it easy for the dogs to identify the stimuli of thermal radiation as the relevant stimuli. Remaining inequalities between the two sides in the set-up could not help the dogs to make correct choices because the animals equally often had to choose the left or the right side, while nothing was physically moved from left to right or vice versa. Stimuli were presented following computer-generated pseudo-random lists with a maximum of three consecutive equal choices in a row<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Longer series of equal choices may lead to side preferences of the animal, which would compromise the experiments. The centers of the panels were 460&#x02009;mm apart (=16 degrees from leading edge of the divider).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Experimental procedure</title><p id="Par28">The first steps in the training were to teach the dog the operation of the sliders and to make it realize that there was an accessible food reward on the warm side. The experimenter stood behind the sliders, with the radiating body heat shielded by plywood to a height of 1.4&#x02009;m (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). From this position, the experimenter opened the roller blind and called the dog into the arena. In the beginning, the slider with the <italic>warm</italic> stimulus was opened partially, so that the food reward became visible to the dog as soon as it had entered the arena. In addition, the experimenter pointed toward the <italic>warm</italic> side. When the dog had learned the basic procedure, the slider displaying the <italic>warm</italic> stimulus was also closed when the blind was opened and the experimenter pointed to the <italic>warm</italic> side with a small delay to let the dog collect sensory information before help was offered. Pointing was terminated when the focus of the entering dog had shifted from the experimenter toward the panels. A choice was recorded as correct or incorrect as soon as the dog&#x02019;s head had passed the leading edge of the divider. Meaningful learning curves were not obtained because the dogs had help while learning the task.</p><p id="Par29">When the dog without help consistently chose correctly in 70% of the training trials, stimulus size was reduced by covers that were hooked onto both panel surfaces facing the dog. The covers consisted of 10&#x02009;mm expanded polystyrene foam laminated on 5&#x02009;mm of Masonite and were painted black. Each cover concealed the entire panel surface facing the dog, except for a central hole 102&#x02009;mm&#x02009;in diameter that let the radiation from the panel surface reach the dog. A free space of about 10&#x02009;mm between the panel surface and the back of the cover allowed for undisturbed convection of air at the <italic>warm</italic> surface in order to avoid excessive warming of the panel. The covers reduced the stimulus to a solid angle of 3.7 degrees. Three covers were available, so that the one used on the <italic>warm</italic> panel surface could cool down before it was used again in order to avoid notable warming by continuous use. Rotating use of three covers also avoided any meaningful cues from nose prints left by the dog when pushing the <italic>warm</italic> side open.</p><p id="Par30">Pointing was temporarily reintroduced (for several sessions) under these circumstances: after introduction of the covers, after prolonged periods of experimental inactivity (e.g. summer break), or if the dog focused only on the experimenter. For data collection, we did a maximum of 15 trials in each session, so that the dog could stay alert during the entire experiment. For each dog, there was an individually predefined stop criterion (Kevin: needed longer than 13&#x02009;sec to make a choice two times in a row; Delfi: rhinarium temperature exceeded 21.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; Charlie: needed longer than 13&#x02009;seconds). Data collection sessions were at least five trials long and were performed double-blind. The experimenter left the room while a second person set up the trial. The experimenter entered the room and took the usual position, opened the blind, and without knowledge of the correct answer, called the dog into the arena. A few training sessions were necessary to let the dog accept the change in routine and reach the learning criterion again.</p><p id="Par31">Double-blind testing took place only if rhinarium skin surface temperatures were 21.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;18.9, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6) or lower.

We wanted to make sure that the dogs were ready to collaborate and testing sessions were therefore terminated if warming to temperatures higher than the above-mentioned limit occurred.

The average of maximal movements per dog was below 1.5&#x02009;mm for the translation directions, and below 0.01 radians for the rotation directions. The anatomical images of the dogs were then transformed into a common space, with a selected template (golden retriever, male, 7.5 years), using the Thermo Scientific Amira for LifeSciences 6.0 software platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/industrial/electron-microscopy/electron-microscopy-instruments-workflow-solutions/3d-visualization-analysis-software/amira-life-sciences-biomedical.html">https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/industrial/electron-microscopy/electron-microscopy-instruments-workflow-solutions/3d-visualization-analysis-software/amira-life-sciences-biomedical.html</ext-link>).
